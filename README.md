# nustar-blanksky
In-progress repository containing supplemental information for NuSTAR blank-sky DM analysis, [arXiv:2207.04572](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04572).

## List of major changes to [arXiv:2207.04572](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04572):

### v1 to v2:
- Fig. 1 -- changed x-axis to linear scale for consistency with Fig. 2.
- Fig. 2 -- new figure showing distribution of exposure times versus angular distance from Galactic Center.
- Fig. 5 -- new figure comparing DM decay rates from many NuSTAR analyses.
- Sec. V-C -- explicitly described why the excesses in mass ranges ~7.8--8.5 keV, ~11--12 keV, ~13--14 keV, ~18--19 keV, and ~21--22 keV are not consistent with DM.
- Fig. 6 -- found error in plotting the new (blue) mixing-angle constraints; after fixing the bug, constraints for masses ~30--40 keV are strengthened by a factor of a few. Also fixed error in plotting 3.5-keV point and XMM constraint.
- Sec. V-D -- added additional discussion of E ~ 3.5 keV feature in NuSTAR background; expanded discussion of BBN and structure-formation limits

### v2 to v3:
- Updated affiliations and acknowledgements
- Added "complementary" to legend of Fig. 6 to emphasize that our present results are complementary to previous NuSTAR constraints
- Minor fixes/corrections to body text, conclusions unchanged
